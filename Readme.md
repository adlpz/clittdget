## Clittdget

**Clittdget** is a simple command-line tool for streaming an user's
twitter feed so it can be consumed by other tools following the Unix
philosophy.

Yeah I know the name sucks and probably implies all sorts of innuendos,
but I'm a man of limited imagination.

# About

Clittdget is written in **Javascript** so it can be run on **Node.js**.

Of course the, it requires **Node.js**.

# Usage

Edit *secret.js* so it contains your keys from Twitter. Then just run

    $ ./app.js
